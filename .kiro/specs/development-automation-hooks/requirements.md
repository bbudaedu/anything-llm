# Development Automation Hooks Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive set of agent hooks designed to automate and streamline the AnythingLLM development workflow. These hooks will reduce human error, ensure consistency, and improve development efficiency by automating repetitive tasks and enforcing quality standards throughout the development lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality Enforcement Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks to run when I save files, so that I can catch issues early and maintain consistent code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JavaScript/JSX file is saved THEN the system SHALL automatically run ESLint checks
2. WHEN a code file is saved THEN the system SHALL verify i18n compliance (no hardcoded user-facing text)
3. WHEN linting errors are found THEN the system SHALL display errors in the IDE and offer auto-fix options
4. WHEN code style violations are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically format the code using Prettier
5. IF critical errors are found THEN the system SHALL prevent file save until issues are resolved

### Requirement 2: Test Automation Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically when I modify code, so that I can ensure my changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component file is saved THEN the system SHALL automatically run related unit tests
2. WHEN test files are modified THEN the system SHALL run the specific test suite
3. WHEN API endpoint files are changed THEN the system SHALL run integration tests for those endpoints
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information and suggest fixes
5. IF no tests exist for a new component THEN the system SHALL offer to generate basic test templates

### Requirement 3: Development Environment Validation Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my development environment to be automatically validated, so that I can avoid common setup issues and ensure consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is opened THEN the system SHALL verify Node.js version >= 18
2. WHEN package.json is modified THEN the system SHALL verify yarn is being used instead of npm
3. WHEN environment files are missing THEN the system SHALL offer to create them from templates
4. WHEN Prisma schema is modified THEN the system SHALL prompt to run migrations
5. IF development services are not running THEN the system SHALL offer to start them automatically

### Requirement 4: Internationalization Compliance Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic i18n compliance checking, so that all user-facing text supports internationalization from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components are saved THEN the system SHALL scan for hardcoded user-facing text
2. WHEN hardcoded text is found THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate translation keys
3. WHEN new translation keys are added THEN the system SHALL verify they exist in both English and Chinese locale files
4. WHEN locale files are modified THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure and key consistency
5. IF missing translations are detected THEN the system SHALL offer to generate placeholder translations

### Requirement 5: API Documentation Sync Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API documentation to stay synchronized with code changes, so that documentation is always accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoint files are modified THEN the system SHALL update Swagger documentation
2. WHEN new endpoints are added THEN the system SHALL generate basic API documentation templates
3. WHEN data models are changed THEN the system SHALL update related API schemas
4. WHEN JSDoc comments are modified THEN the system SHALL regenerate API documentation
5. IF API documentation is outdated THEN the system SHALL warn developers and offer to update it

### Requirement 6: Database Migration Safety Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database changes to be handled safely, so that I don't accidentally break the database or lose data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Prisma schema files are modified THEN the system SHALL validate schema syntax
2. WHEN breaking changes are detected THEN the system SHALL warn about potential data loss
3. WHEN migrations are generated THEN the system SHALL create backup recommendations
4. WHEN migration files are created THEN the system SHALL run them in development environment
5. IF migration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide resolution guidance

### Requirement 7: Component Architecture Compliance Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure new components follow AnythingLLM architecture patterns, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new React components are created THEN the system SHALL verify they follow the standard structure
2. WHEN components are saved THEN the system SHALL check for proper PropTypes definitions
3. WHEN hooks are created THEN the system SHALL verify they follow naming conventions (use prefix)
4. WHEN context providers are added THEN the system SHALL ensure proper error boundaries
5. IF architecture violations are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for fixes

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor performance impacts of my changes, so that I can maintain optimal application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bundle size increases significantly THEN the system SHALL warn about performance impact
2. WHEN large dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives or lazy loading
3. WHEN components are saved THEN the system SHALL check for performance anti-patterns
4. WHEN build times increase THEN the system SHALL identify potential optimization opportunities
5. IF memory leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guidance

### Requirement 9: Security Compliance Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic security checks, so that I can prevent common security vulnerabilities from being introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input handling code is added THEN the system SHALL check for proper validation
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL verify authentication middleware is applied
3. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL run security vulnerability scans
4. WHEN sensitive data handling is detected THEN the system SHALL ensure proper encryption/sanitization
5. IF security issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide remediation guidance

### Requirement 10: Git Workflow Integration Hook

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Git operations to be integrated with quality checks, so that only high-quality code gets committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to commit THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit quality checks
2. WHEN creating branches THEN the system SHALL verify proper naming conventions (feature/, fix/, etc.)
3. WHEN pushing changes THEN the system SHALL ensure all tests pass
4. WHEN merging branches THEN the system SHALL verify code review requirements are met
5. IF commit messages don't follow conventions THEN the system SHALL suggest proper format
